# CI/CD Lightning Talk Demo

This is just a dummy repo for my talk :) Here is some dummy text ChatGPT spewed out to make this README look legit.

# Project XYZ - CI/CD Pipeline with Self-Hosted Runners

## Overview

Welcome to Project XYZ! This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using self-hosted runners. Our goal is to showcase a streamlined workflow for building, testing, and deploying code in an automated manner.

## Features

- **Automated Build & Test**: Every commit triggers an automated build and test process, ensuring code integrity and functionality.
- **Self-Hosted Runners**: Utilizes self-hosted runners for greater control over the CI/CD environment.
- **Deployment Automation**: Automatic deployment to staging or production environments upon successful build and test completion.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker (for containerized environments)
- Knowledge of CI/CD concepts

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-xyz.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-xyz`
3. (Optional) Customize the CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/`

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is defined under `.github/workflows/` and consists of several stages:

1. **Build**: Compiles the code and builds the application.
2. **Test**: Runs unit and integration tests to validate code changes.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the build to the specified environment.

## Self-Hosted Runners Configuration

Our self-hosted runners are configured to provide a secure, efficient, and controlled execution environment. See `RUNNERS.md` for setup and configuration details.
